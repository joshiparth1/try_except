# try_except
task 1:
This program reads content from a file named `sample.txt`.  
It prints each line with its line number.  
If the file doesn't exist, it shows a proper error message.

task 2:
This program writes user input to `output.txt`, appends more text, and displays the final content.  
It uses write (`w`), append (`a`), and read (`r`) modes.  
Simple demonstration of file handling in Python.
